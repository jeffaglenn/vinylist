# Vinyl Collection App - TODO

## üü• High Priority Issues

### Album Art Storage Cleanup
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Description**: When albums are deleted, the cover art images remain in the Supabase `album-art` storage bucket
**Impact**: Storage costs will accumulate over time with orphaned files
**Resolution**: Storage deletion now works for both album edit (removal/replacement) and album deletion. Orphaned files are properly cleaned up.
**Current State**:
- Database deletion works properly
- UI updates correctly
- Storage API `.remove()` calls now succeed and files are deleted as expected
- Service role key is configured correctly
