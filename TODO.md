# Vinyl Collection App - TODO

## üü• High Priority Issues

### Album Art Storage Cleanup
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Description**: When albums are deleted, the cover art images remain in the Supabase `album-art` storage bucket
**Impact**: Storage costs will accumulate over time with orphaned files
**Resolution**: Storage deletion now works for both album edit (removal/replacement) and album deletion. Orphaned files are properly cleaned up.
**Current State**:
- Database deletion works properly
- UI updates correctly
- Storage API `.remove()` calls now succeed and files are deleted as expected
- Service role key is configured correctly

## üìù Notes

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React Server Components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### Key Files to Remember
- `src/app/api/albums/[id]/route.ts` - Album deletion API (storage cleanup issue)
- `src/components/albums/AlbumGrid.tsx` - Main album display component
- `src/components/ui/ConfirmationDialog.tsx` - Reusable confirmation dialog
- `.env.local` - Environment configuration (service role key)

### Database Schema Notes
- Albums table has `is_active` column for soft deletes (currently using hard deletes)
- Cover art URLs are stored as full Supabase Storage URLs
- User ownership is enforced through RLS policies
